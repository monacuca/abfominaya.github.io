It has been a year since I moved to NYC and began working.


Independence is a gift that not everyone has and it's moments like this where I come to appreciate the strides I have taken relative to myself at 18. I wish I could show that version of myself the successes and confidence I have, like *"Hey! Angie! Look, a everything you have done. You live alone, through college you financially supported yourself. At ever step, your successes have been yours only."* Because myself at 18 was so worried about making it and so scared of the world and growing up.

I am here to celebrate who I have become, relative to who I was then:
- I have learned to take better care of myself and my body. 
- I have become more oranized, focused, passionate.
- I still have a lot to improve on but I hope that one day I will look back at today with pride too.
