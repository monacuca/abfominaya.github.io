It has been a year since I moved to NYC and began working.


Independence is a gift that not everyone has and it's moments like this where I come to appreciate the strides I have taken relative to myself at 18. I wish I could show that version of myself the successes and confidence I have, like "Hey! Angie! Look, a everything you have done. You live alone, through college you financially supported yourself. At ever step, your successes have been yours only." Because myself at 18 was so worried about making it and so scared of the world and growing up.


I am here to celebrate who I have become.


I have become more oranized, focused, passionate. I have learned to take better care of myself and my body. 


I still have a lot to improve on but I hope that one day I will look back at today with pride too.
