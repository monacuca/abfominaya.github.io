I am an NYC-based Colombian fine artist and software engineer currently working at Google. My name is <i>Angelica Bonilla Fominaya</i> <del> (excluding middle names and Catholic naming conventions)</del>, I also go by <b> A. B. Fominaya</b>. 
<br>
<br>
I am interested in exploring different ways in which people can collaborate with machines, specifically towards co-creation. My recent work explores computerized machine knitting, plotters, and collaborative robot arms to address different elements of generativity and machine interaction.
