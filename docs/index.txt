## Abstract:
We introduce solid knitting, a new fabrication technique that combines the layer-by-layer volumetric approach of 3D printing with the topologically-entwined stitch structure of knitting to produce solid 3D objects. We define the basic building blocks of solid knitting and demonstrate a working prototype of a solid knitting machine controlled by a low-level instruction language, along with a volumetric design tool for creating machine-knittable patterns. Solid knitting uses a course-wale-layer structure, where every loop in a solid-knit object passes through both a loop from the previous layer and a loop from the previous course. Our machine uses two beds of latch needles to create stitches like a conventional V-bed knitting machine, but augments these needles with a pair of rotating hook arrays to provide storage locations for all of the loops in one layer of the object. It can autonomously produce solid-knit prisms of arbitrary length, although it requires manual intervention to cast on the first layer and bind off the final row. Our design tool allows users to create solid knitting patterns by connecting elementary stitches; objects designed in our interface can---after basic topological checks and constraint propagation---be exported as a sequence of instructions for fabrication on the solid knitting machine. We validate our solid knitting hardware and software on prism examples, detail the mechanical errors which we have encountered, and discuss potential extensions to the capability of our solid knitting machine.
4:T4e01,# Alphabet Soup: The case of the weird girl, whomever she might be.

## Note:
I don’t intend to reflect the opinions of other non-conforming young women who ever felt excluded. 


At the same time, this work represents a commentary to our collective struggles, for being repeatedly excluded or otherwise isolated.


To this day, I still don’t know if some of these things are universal experiences that every single girl has, because as women, we are seldom seen as complex, layered human beings. 


## Alphabet Soup

I find myself writing this over and over in my head, trying to find ways in which I can formalize how I feel about “it”.


“It” being how I feel about myself and how I come to terms with growing up sensitive, intelligent, passionate and **excluded**. 


Growing up, I spent a lot of time thinking of the ways in which I was different. I wasn’t shy, I wasn’t academically challenged in the ways many kids with learning disabilities are. There wasn’t a particular trait about me that inherently signaled me as atypical. 


I was just weird.


I often found myself in social conflicts – perpetuated by my own bluntness. I cried when things didn’t go my way, and felt myself disjoint from the social dynamics in my classrooms. But nobody around me ever thought these things symbolized an inherent developmental delay, these things represented social struggles and personality flaws that everyone (to some extent) deals with. I was often called intolerant, rude, picky and a crybaby – because I often found it difficult to deal with the complexity in the world, sounds sometimes felt too bright and lights too loud. So I cried, or snapped. For me, these behaviors did not stem as early signs of manipulative tactics or coddling, as young girls are often accused of, but genuinely finding it difficult to ground myself in overwhelming environments. 


By all means, I was an extroverted child. I loved befriending my teachers, older students and people that would find interest in my unique way of viewing the world, but this often didn’t leave a lot of room for kids my age. I was still weird.


It could have been the way I was raised, maybe I was “malcriada”, but would boys my age be punished for showing different emotions of equivalent fervor? Maybe. But these would be signs of sensitivity or early passion. Or maybe they too, would face unconventional labels upon reaching adulthood. **So where do we draw the line and define what needs to be pathologized? How do we evaluate ourselves to understand if we fit within the framework of a disabled identity?**


I lived the first ten years of my life in Colombia, and in a way, it seemed like the warm weather of the Caribbean predisposed our society of being extroverted. Personally, I don’t think you could find a human being that spoke more than me, I loved talking. I still do and in an environment where being hyperactive and talkative is the social norm, I didn’t feel weird for this. Though from the start, I still stood out in more than one way. I don’t recall shyness existing until I moved to the US. Sure, there were kids that spoke more than others, but we were mostly socialized in communal spaces and the general openness of the culture often meant that shy traits were "taught" out of children. This is anecdotal of course, it could be that time has rendered memory faint, but I recall a stark difference in the way my communities felt. When I moved to the United States, I could sense a difference in the ease of making friendships, not that it was ever particularly easy for me, the gap between myself and other children felt bigger.


Even then, at 10, I already had multiple falling outs with friends, an inability to fit into social groups, notes from teachers at parent-teachers conferences about my talkativeness and hyperactivity. The only friends I could have needed to be discrete, singular, and exist in such a way that I could devote my attention and love solely to them. Things often didn’t go my way otherwise, group settings often bringing out the worst aspects of myself. In a way, leaving Colombia was okay in this regard. I did miss the one friend I had, Jairito, who at the time was my crutch after my falling out with my best friend of three years, Maria Isabela. At this point, I already disliked fundamental aspects of myself, I carried them in my mind as a little list:

1. I hated that I couldn’t maintain friendships.
2. I hated that I spoke too much, I hated that I was blonde.
3. I hated that I was paler than everyone else in my family.
4. I hated that my smile was teethy, rectangular, wide and ugly. 


I hated that I was leaving the home I always had even if I found a new start potentially exciting. 


I met my first love later that year, *Danny Phantom*. I watched the show over and over again, in love with the idea of Netflix and the ability to relive my favorite series over and over again. I had shows I truly loved before, *H2O: Just Add Water, Winx Club* and *Grachi*, where girls often found themselves with secret abilities and a community around their secrets. Maybe I wasn’t craving the uniqueness that came with having powers, but rather I was craving the community that came with being uniquely unusual and markedly different. 


That year I became truly devoted to the idea of becoming an artist, drawing each panel and attempting to imitate Butch Hartman’s art. I had other loves before, but nothing as joyful as Danny Phantom yet. Falling in love with a cartoon allowed me to disregard the areas of my life that worried me, like the fact I was only visiting Colombia for a short while and like the fact that I would go back to New Jersey, where once again I only had a singular friend. Every day in New Jersey, I would give myself a challenge to see how long I could go without speaking. By lunch, I usually had already lost and I would develop a pit of guilt and wished I could simply be “less”.


That year, I got really into Anime, this is how I met my current best friend, Rose. Rose and I met on instagram, I was 12 and she was 11, she taught me about “roleplaying”, where you take turns taking the identity of characters to developing prose to tell complex stories.  Rose introduced me to the idea that I could have friends outside of my real life, and she too was struggling at the time with the impending feelings of isolation. She wouldn’t be the only girl I befriended like myself. I met Joana, a girl from Portugal who was unable to go to school because of emotions she could not name. Shakira, who shared the obsessive love I had with Homestuck at the time. These girls still remain the best friends I have ever had, and still share those feelings of isolation with me. In my daily “real” life, I still actively struggled with fitting in, something that led me to get suspended in sixth grade (wild story, which I will tell you about at a different time in another blog post). At 14, I received a Skype message from a friend, with every grievance she had about me which fundamentally made me internalize that every social failing I had, was fundamentally caused by me. Because of this and other experiences, I felt extreme guilt for every relationship I was unable to preserve. To this day, I have conditioned myself to constantly analyze how my behaviors, thoughts, and feelings are different from other people.


I struggle with this intrinsic feeling of otherness. 


I started contemplating if I was autistic when I was around 13 years old. I found it difficult to come to terms with the idea of self diagnosis, but I found myself secreting scouring stories of other girls in WrongPlanet forum. At the time, this diagnosis was Aspergers and my friend Joana had recently been diagnosed with it. I found that my feeling of isolation and sensitivities stemmed from this. In a way this would explain the pain I experienced from being socially isolated. This was a secret I kept to myself, for the most part. At some point, I looked back at this version of myself and thought she was wrong – 
1. I became really good at talking to people.
2. I never really struggled with eye contact.
3. Adults liked me.
4. My voice was loud and clear. I talked a lot. 

I just had a bad personality, which one day enough guilt would cause me to finally repent from every misgiving I had.


In fact, I had asked my guidance counselor at the time and she said I did not seem to have Asperger’s Syndrome because I made good eye contact, despite my social struggles and being the only girl who thought it was normal to go every day to my guidance counselor for social advice. I settled on thinking I maybe had ADHD instead, because I felt different and my thoughts still felt out of control. Being extremely talkative, disorganized, moving a lot and going through life like a bullet reinforced this even if I didn’t feel like it impacted me as much.


As a young teen I didn’t have autonomy to find support. My mom was undocumented, I didn’t have insurance, and honestly there was nobody that would believe me. So, I tried not to think about it.


In 2020 I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Generalized in this case, means that the anxiety is all-encompassing and encapsules multiple facets of life. It also impacts and creates a variety of physical symptoms – apparently the fact that I was irritable, rigid and constantly nauseous only reaffirmed this sense.


At that time, I only seeked therapy because I was unable to finish exams and I was developing a crippling fear of coding, something I had taught myself since I was 13 years old. I was surrounded by incredibly privileged kids with backgrounds completely different from mine. All I wanted was a valid, albeit meaningless, diagnosis so I could apply for accommodations in my university, because I knew I was struggling and no amount of studying was preventing me from freezing when I thought about my work. Being in a stressful environment, socially isolated, and struggling with objectively difficult circumstances such as my family’s impending homelessness obviously led to a physical state of anxiety, worry, and nausea. During this time, I also had episodes of obsessive fear regarding my own health, to the point that I avoided looking at myself in mirrors so I wouldn’t analyze the intrinsic differences in my body that might signal I will soon die of cancer. I would consistently ask my loved ones for reassurance, because in mind the only thing worse than homelessness, unemployment, bad grades, or poverty was losing the only thing you could preserve in adversity — health. I eventually had a biopsy to the wound that distressed me, only for it to lead to more concerns. I was worried I had a lymphoma, or brain cancer, MS, and a billion other afflictions. I wasn’t self-diagnosing, I was pathologically worried and deeply pained from the uncertainty of having a secret disease that no doctor could detect in time. Part of me thought that if I thought these things could happen, then in a sense, my thoughts would make them happen. After all, that's a saying my mom often told me – “thoughts have power”.Eventually, I realized if I ignored the issue, it would be as if I never thought about them in the first place. 


These types of concerns faded, with appropriate therapy for the anxiety and newfound confidence in myself as an artist, programmer, and friend. But as my responsibilities grew, so did my stress, and it didn’t help that my family went through additional bouts of homelessness as I became an upperclassman. I developed fears about going to jail for unspeakable crimes, such as placing a sticker in a light post at my university. It wasn’t even that incriminating, something meaningless and silly. I worried about what was wrong with me. I had horrific images of my head spontaneously blowing up on the sidewalk. I never could breathe air I know was shared with sick people, making roommate life difficult for me.


In the summer of 2022, I developed another anxious, obsessive episode over my skin. It was terrifying, ripping my skin because I could not recognize a small mole I always had. It wasn’t cancer, at least. 


I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) later that autumn. Unlike the GAD, this felt like a more intrinsic part of myself, because I started realizing how much my behavior, thoughts and beliefs stemmed from this pathology. It also wasn’t a "basic bitch mental illness", this was a bit more niche and extremely misunderstood. The only good thing about having OCD, is the extreme resilience you develop as you work towards treatment. Having OCD is having to face your biggest, most traumatic fears on a daily basis with no reprieve. It is knowing you are insane, and knowing that your actions and beliefs are fundamentally flawed but feeling such all-encompassing fear that you are forced to keep doing the useless actions that help you cope with these fears. I learned OCD didn’t just affect how I worried about my health, but also morality, certainty and relationships. Coming to accept that I was a person with OCD and understanding that this wasn’t something that went away, but rather was something that needed life-long maintenance, was extremely difficult. I can pinpoint the different ways I was affected by these symptoms since before I was 7. I knew so many other extremely well-adjusted women who confided in me about also struggling with it, but I never felt like it explained every aspect of myself that I found myself questioning. 


Recently, I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation (ADHD-C) and “almost sub-clinical, but just enough for a diagnosis” Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Being diagnosed with four disorders feels wrong, because I know that I am a human, not a collection of diagnoses. I don’t actively struggle with anxiety or OCD at a clinical level anymore, but ADHD and ASD are not things that ever fade away. I am not a human being who is actively struggling, and unable to live my life in a fulfilling way. I have a stable job, friendships,  I graduated from a college degree and will be pursuing a PhD. I am happy, and do not consider myself actively mentally ill. I actually think I am one of the healthiest people I know. 


I am not inherently disordered – I am able to make sense of my life, with successes and failures like anyone. But I just can’t help but feel like this is the result of an external persona who molds herself differently for each person but retains an air of conventional eccentrism. I like this persona, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like it is me. How much “me” is there in “me” and how much are traits composed from my individual neuroses?


Part of me doesn’t feel like these categorical diagnoses explain a fundamental disorder or error in the way I exist. Unlike OCD, these disorders aren’t inherently negative experiences, are a fundamental part of who you are and often diagnosed only by the way others perceive you. In fact, the majority of the criteria for diagnosis in both conditions relies on external behaviors or challenges in a societal context, not inherently about the internal experience of living with these conditions. Learning about the social disability movement has helped me formalize how I feel about these disorders. I don’t think OCD is an inherent ‘difference’ but rather a genuine disorder that caused me and others a lot of pain, but ADHD and ASD describe many traits that can apply to a wide variety of people, without these traits inherently causing them anxiety or distress, only the functional ways in which society fails to accommodate them. These things wouldn’t be considered disorders if we weren’t in a high-paced society, with millions of distractions and an inherent expectation to cope with extraneous or intense sensory stimuli. I am sure we can identify pathways in the brain that one day will explain how ADHD and ASD brains differ from those who don’t have the disorders. It is already hypothesized that both disorders have various loci associated with them, but specific combinations of these genes cause the presentation of someone with ADHD or autism. This doesn’t inherently mean that our brains are damaged. Just like there is a gene for red headed people, there are genes that might predispose people to certain personalities and behaviors. In twin studies, correlations have been found with autism and ADHD, but it’s not a complete guarantee, as your environment can influence how your personality and other traits develop. It is hard to find a justification that these things are disorders in my mind, because to me they represent a natural part of humanity and don’t inherently negatively impact those diagnosed with it. Obviously, various degrees of suffering exist because of these conditions, but that is not because of us. The things that impact us, is the fact that we are categorically excluded and raised in a society where our traits predispose us for failure. This is a societal issue, not an inherent failure in our brains.  


To put it in other words, I don’t think these are emotions inherent to an impending neurodivergence, or inherent to any single atypicality in any of us. I think these are emotions that stem from growing up isolated, often as intelligent, bright, or passionate. 


Especially as girls.


Girls who may struggle with emotional regulation, but aren’t identified as needing help, because our male peers with the same struggles often become disruptive and externalizing, while we internalize and think of our challenges as moral failings. 


Although I am writing this from the perspective of someone who struggled with mental health, and who fits the criteria for these neurodevelopmental disorders, I think these things can apply to every other trait that leads us to feel isolated. 


I just wish we were kinder to smart, weird girls, who may be lesbians, intelligent or otherwise a bit weird. Because we have a lot to give in the world, but existing is kind of traumatic. This is pretty much the root of all of my anxieties, if I was more accepted I don't think I would have developed so much anxiety as a young adult for simply existing. And as I heal I realize that this anxiety isn't inherent in me, I wasn’t born with it, but rather the ways I was treated in society built this. We all find ways, internally, to justify that it is not us who is responsible for the things in our lives that flagged us as different. Some of my good friends have found that this sense of “difference” stemmed from their homosexuality, tomboyness, personality types or other traits. I don’t think it is possible to pinpoint the things that flag us to others as potential targets for mistreatment, or what brings about the inherent feeling of being different. I think this is one of the reasons why so many young women are coming forward and identifying as autistic or otherwise neurodivergent – it is because we have come to find comfort in identities that help us justify why we were treated in negative ways. I used to be very cynical about self diagnoses, in large part because human beings have a hard time evaluating their own behaviors. 


Confirmation bias exists, and we are not able to often identify when we fall prey to it. I have learned, though, that concrete labels aren’t made for human beings – we aren’t specimens to be taxonomized and if we find labels that help us come to terms with why our differences make us feel alienated, then perhaps that is enough. Fundamentally, growing up feeling inherently isolated or different from your peers is traumatic and we come to find comfort in the communities that make us feel accepted.

## Abstract:
We show that a linear model is sufficient to accurately estimate the quantity of yarn that goes into a knitted item produced on an automated knitting machine. Knitted fabrics are complex structures, yet their diverse properties arise from the arrangement of a small number of discrete, additive operations. One can estimate the masses of each of these basic yarn additions using linear regression and, in turn, use these masses to estimate the overall quantity (and local distribution) of yarn within any knitted fabric. Our proposed linear model achieves low error on a range of fabrics and generalizes to different yarns and stitch sizes. This paves the way for applications where having a known yarn distribution is important for accuracy (e.g., simulation) or cost estimation (e.g., design).
6:Tdee,Various types of algorithmic textile approaches have been historically employed to create soft objects– from the use of industrial knitting fabrics using computerized knitting or weaving machines to 3D knitting of hollow materials (to create objects such as plush toys, socks or shirts). Currently, there are developments allowing for the construction of completely solidly knit objects. For my capstone I am interested in constructing a series of knit objects for a large-scale installation. Specifically, I wanted to use 3D knitting, solid knitting, and computerized machine knitting to create a fully knit installation. I was able to successfully accomplish this. 

## Background
Knitting has served as one of the foundations of society, providing us with footwear, clothing, accessories and equipment. It is a craft associated with labor politics, femininity and traditionalism — yet it is also a craft that we wear on an almost-daily basis. As a craft, it is one of the oldest in existence, rivaled only by weaving.  It is an integral part of our history and it contains thematic and computational value that deserves to be explored.  Solid knitting is a novel type of knitting that is being currently developed at the CMU Textiles Lab. With solid knitting, we have the potential to create completely solid knit objects, thus allowing us to create knit furniture and other types of sturdy objects. Other methods of knit-based fabrication, such as computerized machine knitting provide ways of algorithmically constructing complex 3D hollow objects or patterns. 

When I was ten years old, I immigrated to the United States from Colombia. I only ever went back twice until the time I graduated from high school. This discrepancy in space and time made me feel like Frankenstein’s monster, stitched together from two worlds in the worst possible way. I knew other kids in my community who regularly had the ability to visit family members and friends. I didn’t have this opportunity, living with an undocumented mother, a sick grandmother, and an alcoholic, dying uncle. 

Through my time in the US, I moved more than ten times. Either between the couches of different family members, or scrappy furnished apartments, filled with stained upholstery and cockroaches. I lost the vision of what a home as a space was supposed to be. When I lived in Colombia, most of the furniture we owned had been in our family for decades. It had seen my mother grow up and was a staple of stability in my childhood. I never questioned the eternity of those objects. 

As a teenager and young adult, I made various pieces to address this disconnect. This emotion developed into my current artistic practice and motivates a lot of the questions I ask myself. 

As an adult, I think a lot about preserving myself and my culture. I think about maintaining the spaces and elements that made these temporary living spaces into homes. Fundamentally, a home is the people, but also the culture you exist within. The idea of constructing objects that are modifiable and that can be compressed into a box is an intimate and emotional idea for me. All that is left behind of my childhood is images and memories, subject to physical, digital or mental decay. 

For this reason, I wanted to create a fragment of this space in real life. I built a completely knit chair that can easily be assembled and disassembled by a person. I built a set where people can position themselves unknowingly in my cultural context. They can wear my mask, forced to become a version of me.7:T702,## About this project:
This project is a piece that contextualizes my failure in attempting to have a robot dance with me.
My goal, at its core, was creating a robotic interaction that would follow me as I moved or danced with it. But I wasn't able to get quite there. I spent roughly 2 months continuously debugging a UR5 Cobot (Collaborative Robot), as I attempted to have it follow my face in real time.  Using Handsfree.js, Python and a couple of dozen cups of coffee, I was able to partially achieve this daunting task. Without getting too much into the technical implementation of my robotic interactions, I had a lot of issues wrapping my head around different SDK's and networking protocols for communicating with the robot with my computer.

It's not easy to make code for the robot to move, but it's even harder to do so remotely from your computer. So I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how these pieces went together. I eventually hacked it, but I realized that to get to a step where the robot would be able to move smoothly with me, would take a lot more time and effort than I had. At this point I had grown bitter with the robot, verbally abusing it every time I could. Because I knew it would never be good enough to properly dance with me at this rate.


Needless to say, this piece as a whole is a testament to the technical failures that I experienced, technical failures that made me reconsider my position as a technologist. This piece was the process of coming to terms with my lack of technical expertise, but it is also a testament to my learning and a love letter to my culture and my language.


This work was exhibited in the Carnegie Mellons' Experimental Capture Final Exhibition.

(For the best experience, please wear headphones)

For this project, I was interested in exploring the variation that exists through the sensory experiences of different human beings. As someone who is rather sensitive to sound due to misophonia, I was interested in how different people react to different unusual sounds. For example, chewing sounds might be appealing to someone who experiences ASMR or absolutely distressing (and even enraging) for someone who has misphonia.  Most people lie somewhere in between these two experiences, and through their faces they reveal a lot about how they experience these distinct auditory inputs.

Throughout multiple iterations of this project, I was interested in exploring the variety that exists in human emotions-- whether they be my own or someone else's. Upon exploring auditory input, I was introduced to this project by Olivia Cunnally, which captures Grima — a mostly universal response to deeply unsettling sounds. Since sound is something I struggle with, I decided to double down on this idea.

To create this project, I had to first generate the audio using a 3Dio Binaural microphone. This binaural microphone accurately places auditory input in 3D space, making it feel like sounds are either close or further from you. With a combination of hand sanitizer, water, my mouth and pin, I was able to generate an array of sounds to sample from. I ended up with approximately 30 minutes of audio. I then chose the most disturbing audio samples (through the feedback of my friends Bella and Lauren) and used them to create a 5 minute video.

I then recorded various reactions from unsuspecting participants using my phone's 240 fps slow-motion camera. I told each person that they would be listening to 5 minutes of potentially distressing audio and that I would be recording their reactions. Finally, I compiled 12 of the video reactions I recorded into a 4 x 3 grid with their reactions synchronized to the audio. The video and audio were slowed down by a factor of 0.5, to make expressions more dramatic.

Overall, I am very pleased with how this project turned out. I am not someone who regularly works either with video or audio, so I know there is a lot of room for improvement in how I conducted my project. First, I think there might be a couple of points where the video isn't perfectly synchronized to the audio.  I think this is due to me synchronizing the videos using the original audio of the video clips themselves (via a click) and joining them. Instead I should've used visual cues to make this easier for myself (having people clap, for instance).  I do think this is something I can revise, but I have been having issues with the size of my project, so exporting and editing has been taking a very long time (I will not use Lightworks again). In the end, I am still very pleased with the final outcome but I have learned to be more cognizant of my videography for the future!<br>
9:T714,## About this project
This project emerged as an exploration of the complex history of banana 
cultivation in the Colombian Caribbean. Earlier this semester, I visited 
this region of Colombia and noticed the subtle ways
in which the banana industry impacted the language, culture, and
stories people told. This industry also fundamentally shaped relations
within the region and instituted ecological and political violence,
prompting generations of unspoken trauma. Chiquita, formerly
known as the United Fruit Company, massacred thousands of banana
workers in Magdalena in 1928 and since then this company has not
relented its grip on the region, to the point of instituting paramil-
tary violence against its workers until 2018 to prevent any halt in
banana cultivation.


Aside from the influence of the American Banana industries, this
region has a rich history, culture, and mythos. I am fascinated by the
mythological complexity of these stories, and for this reason, I chose
to make this film about Mojana. In this film, I used illustrations to
recount Mojana's surreal narrative and omnipotence in conjunction
with Toto la Momposina's Mojana. Mojana is a spirit that rep-
resents a post-colonial Colombian woman, who has chosen to adv-
cate for freedom in her life, becoming one with the Magdalena River.


Yet in the lyrics of the song, there's a struggle to restrain her. By
making Mojana a protector of the forest and people, her story is a
stand-in for resilience.


Visually, I considered using color and embedded subtitles with my own
font in the video itself, however as I was making the video I realized
that these elements might take away from the power of the visuals
of the piece. For this reason, I opted to use adjustable captioning
which could be toggled.a:T7ee,# MoonBuddy: A Voice-based Augmented Reality User Interface That Supports Astronauts During Extravehicular Activities.

## Abstract:
As NASA pursues Artemis missions to the moon and beyond, it is 
essential to equip astronauts with the appropriate human-autonomy 
enabling technology necessary for the elevated demands of lunar 
surface exploration and extreme terrestrial access. We present 
MoonBuddy, an application built for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 that 
utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) and voice-based interaction to assist 
astronauts in communication, navigation, and documentation on 
future lunar extravehicular activities (EVAs), with the goal of reducing 
cognitive load and increasing effective task completion.
We performed a preliminary evaluation at the Johnson Space Center,
Houston, TX, USA, in an area that simulates the lunar surface and
its lighting conditions. During testing, participants used MoonBuddy to 
navigate to three different geological sampling sites, collect rock 
samples, and perform a search and rescue mission to find a distressed 
crew member. Overall, participants appreciated the simple voice 
commands, the guided nature of MoonBuddy, and the surface
edge detection feature that helped them avoid hazards during navigation.

## Personal note:
I led and organized team of 8 designers, artists and programmers to develop an AR application for EVA
assistance, which we had the opportunity to test NASA Johnson Space Center. We wrote a poster and paper
detailing implementation details, which was accepted and is to be presented in UIST'22. To create this project
we received grants from the Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium and Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute.b:T82f,## About this project:
For this project, there were two main topics I wanted to research and integrate. First, I wanted to examine how movements
spread and communicate, specifically in the context of Latin American feminism. I also wanted to explore the intimacy
of printmaking, its purpose in spreading information, and how this could be integrated with algorithmic processes as a bridge of two distinct languages. I began this project by parsing through hundreds of videos of modern-day protest performances
in various Latin American cities, many of these performances utilized simple choreographies and lyrics that allowed for easy transmission of the movement itself. These videos originated as a response to various global issues for women, from
femicide and rape to the treatment of women in online settings.

I found that the transmission of information in each video was evocative in the same way prints and written pieces that kickstarted social movements were evocative. My goal at first was to aggregate the content in these videos into new
messages, where each print displayed a different frame of a found video with a distinct call to action in lieu of the lyrics. I made different types of text generators, from Markov Chains to Tracery grammars and traditional generative text
methods.

As I iterated this process, I began to focus more on the lyrical quality of specific videos and I kept coming back to “Un Violador En Tu Camino” (A Rapist in Your Path) by Chilean collective Colectivo Las Tesis. This video was incredibly
striking to me by the raw power it had in mobilizing people and enacting change, despite being a simple (non-violent) communal performance. As such, I sourced my videos and text from this specific work and moved my project towards an adaptation
of this video removing the use of generative text. Using the traditional language in printmaking, I decided to frame each print as a work of art, with the lyrics presented as a title in an editorial print. These prints then got converted into
a gif, recontextualizing them in a digital space.c:T454,## About this project:
I went through hundreds of testimonies 
of victims (or their families) who suffered from the violence from the Colombian military, 
to the ELN, to the different paramilitary groups, to the FARC and female victims of assault 
through the different periods of armed conflict. I created a clock that through the period
of ten minutes, displays a unique version of these stories. The hardest part of this piece
was trying to find a way of approaching this sensitive topic in a proper and respectful way,
I translated a lot of the anecdotes at first quite literally, but many of the stories were
violent and incredibly difficult to digest. There is also often a difficulty in trying to
describe the violence that exists in Latin America without make it 
the defining quality of these nations. It often feels like as a Colombian, so many of our 
conversations are focused on avoiding the armed conflict as a topic, it felt uncomfortable 
to make this piece but I still made it because it is a very real struggle for many, and 
for those who live it every day through memories.
